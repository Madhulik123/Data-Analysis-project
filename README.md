#Dataset Overview
This project analyzes a Heart Attack medical dataset collected at Zheen Hospital, Erbil, Iraq, between January 2019 and May 2019.

The dataset is designed to classify whether a patient experienced a heart attack (positive) or no heart attack (negative) based on key clinical indicators.

#Objective
The primary goal of this project is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and build predictive models to classify heart attack risk using clinical biomarkers and patient data.

#Features (Attributes)
The dataset includes the following variables:

Age – Patient’s age

Gender – Encoded as:

1 = Male

0 = Female

Heart Rate – Beats per minute

Systolic Blood Pressure

Diastolic Blood Pressure

Blood Sugar (Glucose) – Encoded as:

1 = Glucose level > 120

0 = Glucose level ≤ 120

CK-MB – Creatine kinase-MB enzyme level

Troponin – Cardiac biomarker level

Output (Target Variable) –

1 = Positive (Heart Attack)

0 = Negative (No Heart Attack)
